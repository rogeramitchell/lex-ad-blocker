# LEX Ad Blocker

Sometimes you may be in Salesforce Classic, and suddenly you see a modal appear requesting you to try Lightning Experience. It's the new shiny. You should definitely check it out.

But... if you're aware of what it is, and you want to do what you're doing in Classic, it's a bit annoying to close modal ads.

Is this a CRM tool or Forbes.com?

This Chrome extension will hide those prompts so you can continue your work Classically (get it?) and without disruption.
